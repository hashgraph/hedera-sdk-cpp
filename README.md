## SDK IS NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE. IT IS CURRENTLY STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

## Prerequisites

For MacOS and Linux users (these can be installed with `brew install` or `apt-get install`, respectively):

- ninja
- pkg-config

For Windows users:

- Visual Studio 2019/2022 Community/Pro with Universal Windows Platform Development Tools
- [Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/) (`perl.exe` must be added to `%PATH%`)
- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us) (`nasm.exe` must be added to `%PATH%`)

## Build

This project features CMake Presets which simplify the setup of vcpkg based dependencies. The below commands are
typically all that is required.

```sh
# Ensure the VCPkg Submodule is initialized
git submodule update --init

# Windows (x64) Build
cmake --preset windows-x64-release
cmake --build --preset windows-x64-release

# Linux (x64) Build
cmake --preset linux-x64-release
cmake --build --preset linux-x64-release

# MacOS (Intel x64) Build
cmake --preset macos-x64-release
cmake --build --preset macos-x64-release

# MacOS (Aarch64) Build
cmake --preset macos-arm64-release
cmake --build --preset macos-arm64-release
```

## Testing

To run all SDK tests:

```sh
ctest -C Release --test-dir build/<PRESET>
```

To run a specific test:

```sh
ctest -C Release --test-dir build/<PRESET> -R <NAME OF TEST>
```
