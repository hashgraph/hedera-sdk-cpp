/**
 * The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file
 * right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by
 * the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster
 * by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the
 * transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The
 * other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node
 * might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much
 * if the transaction is sent to N nodes.
 *
 * Applicable to Scheduled Transactions:
 *  - The ID of a Scheduled Transaction has transactionValidStart and accountIDs inherited from the
 *    ScheduleCreate transaction that created it. That is to say that they are equal
 *  - The scheduled property is true for Scheduled Transactions
 *  - transactionValidStart, accountID and scheduled properties should be omitted
