/**
 * Wipes the provided amount of fungible or non-fungible tokens from the specified Hedera account. This transaction does
 * not delete tokens from the treasury account. This transaction must be signed by the token's Wipe Key. Wiping an
 * account's tokens burns the tokens and decreases the total supply.
 *
 *  - If the provided account is not found, the transaction will resolve to INVALID_ACCOUNT_ID.
 *  - If the provided account has been deleted, the transaction will resolve to ACCOUNT_DELETED.
 *  - If the provided token is not found, the transaction will resolve to INVALID_TOKEN_ID.
 *  - If the provided token has been deleted, the transaction will resolve to TOKEN_WAS_DELETED.
 *  - If an Association between the provided token and the account is not found, the transaction will resolve to
 *    TOKEN_NOT_ASSOCIATED_TO_ACCOUNT.
 *  - If Wipe Key is not present in the Token, the transaction results in TOKEN_HAS_NO_WIPE_KEY.
 *  - If the provided account is the token's Treasury Account, the transaction results in
 *    CANNOT_WIPE_TOKEN_TREASURY_ACCOUNT.
 *
 * On success, tokens are removed from the account and the total supply of the token is decreased by the wiped amount.
 * The amount provided is in the lowest denomination possible.
 *  - Example: Token A has 2 decimals. In order to wipe 100 tokens from an account, one must provide an amount of 10000.
 *             In order to wipe 100.55 tokens, one must provide an amount of 10055.
 *
 * This transaction accepts zero-unit token wipe operations for fungible tokens (HIP-564).
 *
 * Transaction Signing Requirements:
 *  - Wipe key.
 *  - Transaction fee payer account key.
