/**
 * The transaction used to create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt.
 * It can also be retrieved with a GetByKey query. Threshold values can be defined, and records are generated and stored
 * for 25 hours for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds. This account is charged for each record generated, so the
 * thresholds are useful for limiting record generation to happen only for large transactions.
 *
 * The mPublicKey field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has
 * mReceiverSignatureRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both
 * for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is
 * created, the payer account is charged enough Hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next
 * mAutoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to
 * renew for another mAutoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough Hbars to renew for that long, then the
 * remaining Hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires,
 * then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If the mAutoRenewPeriod field is set, the
 * key of the referenced account must sign.
 *
 * An account must be created in a particular realm. If the realmID is left null, then a new realm will be created with
 * the given admin key. If a new realm has a null adminKey, then anyone can create/modify/delete entities in that realm.
 * But if an admin key is given, then any transaction to create/modify/delete an entity in that realm must be signed by
 * that key, though anyone can still call functions on smart contract instances that exist in that realm. A realm ceases
 * to exist when everything within it has expired and no longer exists.
 *
 * The current API ignores shardID, realmID, and newRealmAdminKey, and creates everything in shard 0 and realm 0, with a
 * null key. Future versions of the API will support multiple realms and multiple shards.
