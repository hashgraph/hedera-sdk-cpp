 * A transaction that deletes a smart contract from a Hedera network. Once a smart contract is marked deleted, you will
 * not be able to modify any of the contract's properties.
 *
 * If a smart contract did not have an admin key defined, you cannot delete the smart contract. You can verify the smart
 * contract was deleted by submitting a smart contract info query to the network. If a smart contract has an associated
 * Hbar balance, you will need to transfer the balance to another Hedera account.
 *
 * Transaction Signing Requirements:
 *  - If the admin key was defined for the smart contract it is required to sign the transaction.
 *  - The client operator's (fee payer account) private key is required to sign the transaction.
