 * A key list key structure where all the keys in the list are required to sign transactions that modify accounts,
 * topics, tokens, smart contracts, or files. A key list can contain a ED25519 or ECDSAsecp256k1 key type.
 *
 * If all the keys in the key list key structure do not sign, the transaction will fail and return an
 * "INVALID_SIGNATURE" error. A key list can have repeated keys. A signature for the repeated key will count as many
 * times as the key is listed in the key list. For example, a key list has three keys. Two of the three public keys in
 * the list are the same. When a user signs a transaction with the repeated key it will account for two out of the three
 * keys required signature.
