/**
 * Associates the provided Hedera account with the provided Hedera token(s). Hedera accounts must be associated with a
 * fungible or non-fungible token first before you can transfer tokens to that account. When you transfer a custom
 * fungible or non-fungible token to the alias account ID, the token association step is skipped and the account will
 * automatically be associated with the token upon creation. In the case of a NON_FUNGIBLE token type, once an account
 * is associated, it can hold any number of NFTs (serial numbers) of that token type. The Hedera account that is
 * associated with a token is required to sign the transaction.
 *
 *  - If the provided account is not found, the transaction will resolve to INVALID_ACCOUNT_ID.
 *  - If the provided account has been deleted, the transaction will resolve to ACCOUNT_DELETED.
 *  - If any of the provided tokens is not found, the transaction will resolve to INVALID_TOKEN_REF.
 *  - If any of the provided tokens has been deleted, the transaction will resolve to TOKEN_WAS_DELETED.
 *  - If an association between the provided account and any of the tokens already exists, the transaction will resolve
 *    to TOKEN_ALREADY_ASSOCIATED_TO_ACCOUNT.
 *  - If the provided account's associations count exceeds the constraint of maximum token associations per account, the
 *    transaction will resolve to TOKENS_PER_ACCOUNT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED.
 *  - On success, associations between the provided account and tokens are made and the account is ready to interact
 *    with the tokens.
 *
 * There is currently no limit on the number of token IDs that can be associated with an account (reference HIP-367).
 * Still, you can see TOKENS_PER_ACCOUNT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED responses for pre-HIP-367 transactions.
 *
 * Transaction Signing Requirements:
 *  - The key of the account to which the token is being associated
 *  - Transaction fee payer account key
