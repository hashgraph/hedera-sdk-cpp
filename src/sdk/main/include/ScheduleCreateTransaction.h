/**
 * A transaction that creates a schedule entity on a Hiero network. The entity ID for a schedule transaction is
 * referred to as the ScheduleId. After successfully executing a schedule create transaction, you can obtain the
 * ScheduleId by requesting the receipt of the transaction immediately after the transaction was executed. The receipt
 * also contains the scheduled transaction ID. The scheduled transaction ID is used to to request the record of the
 * scheduled transaction if it is successfully executed.
 *
 * If two users submit the same schedule create transaction, the first one to reach consensus will create the schedule
 * ID and the second one will have the schedule ID returned in the receipt of the transaction. The receipt status of the
 * second identical schedule transaction will return an "IDENTICAL_SCHEDULE_ALREADY_CREATED" response from the network.
 * The user who submits the second transaction would need to submit a ScheduleSign transaction to add their signature to
 * the schedule transaction.
 *
 * To retain the ability to delete a schedule transaction, you will need to populate the admin key field when creating a
 * schedule transaction. The admin key will be required to sign the ScheduleDelete transaction to delete the scheduled
 * transaction from the network. If you do not assign an admin key during the creation of the schedule transaction, you
 * will have an immutable schedule transaction.
 *
 * Transaction Signing Requirements:
 *  - The key of the account paying for the creation of the schedule transaction.
 *  - The key of the payer account ID paying for the execution of the scheduled transaction.
 *  - If the payer account is not specified, the operator account will be used to pay for the execution by default.
 *  - The admin key if set.
 *  - You can optionally sign with any of the required signatures for the scheduled (inner) transaction. Freeze the
 *    schedule transaction and call the sign() method to add signatures.
