/**
 * Start a new smart contract instance. After the instance is created, the ContractId for it is in the receipt, and can
 * be retrieved by the Record or with a GetByKey query. The instance will run the bytecode, either stored in a
 * previously created file or in the transaction body itself for small contracts.
 *
 * The constructor will be executed using the given amount of gas, and any unspent gas will be refunded to the paying
 * account. Constructor inputs come from the given constructorParameters.
 *  - The instance will exist for autoRenewPeriod seconds. When that is reached, it will renew itself for another
 *    autoRenewPeriod seconds by charging its associated cryptocurrency account (which it creates here). If it has
 *    insufficient cryptocurrency to extend that long, it will extend as long as it can. If its balance is zero, the
 *    instance will be deleted.
 *
 *  - A smart contract instance normally enforces rules, so "the code is law". For example, an ERC-20 contract prevents
 *    a transfer from being undone without a signature by the recipient of the transfer. This is always enforced if the
 *    contract instance was created with the adminKeys being null. But for some uses, it might be desirable to create
 *    something like an ERC-20 contract that has a specific group of trusted individuals who can act as a "supreme
 *    court" with the ability to override the normal operation, when a sufficient number of them agree to do so. If
 *    adminKeys is not null, then they can sign a transaction that can change the state of the smart contract in
 *    arbitrary ways, such as to reverse a transaction that violates some standard of behavior that is not covered by
 *    the code itself. The admin keys can also be used to change the autoRenewPeriod, and change the adminKeys field
 *    itself. The API currently does not implement this ability. But it does allow the adminKeys field to be set and
 *    queried, and will in the future implement such admin abilities for any instance that has a non-null adminKeys.
 *
 *  - If this constructor stores information, it is charged gas to store it. There is a fee in Hbars to maintain that
 *    storage until the expiration time, and that fee is added as part of the transaction fee.
 *
 *  - An entity (account, file, or smart contract instance) must be created in a particular realm. If the realmID is
 *    left null, then a new realm will be created with the given admin key. If a new realm has a null adminKey, then
 *    anyone can create/modify/delete entities in that realm. But if an admin key is given, then any transaction to
 *    create/modify/delete an entity in that realm must be signed by that key, though anyone can still call functions on
 *    smart contract instances that exist in that realm. A realm ceases to exist when everything within it has expired
 *    and no longer exists.
 *
 *  - The current API ignores shardID, realmID, and newRealmAdminKey, and creates everything in shard 0 and realm 0,
 *    with a null key. Future versions of the API will support multiple realms and multiple shards.
 *
 *  - The optional memo field can contain a string whose length is up to 100 bytes. That is the size after Unicode NFD
 *    then UTF-8 conversion. This field can be used to describe the smart contract. It could also be used for other
 *    purposes. One recommended purpose is to hold a hexadecimal string that is the SHA-384 hash of a PDF file
 *    containing a human-readable legal contract. Then, if the admin keys are the public keys of human arbitrators, they
 *    can use that legal document to guide their decisions during a binding arbitration tribunal, convened to consider
 *    any changes to the smart contract in the future. The memo field can only be changed using the admin keys. If there
 *    are no admin keys, then it cannot be changed after the smart contract is created.
 *
 * Signing requirements: If an admin key is set, it must sign the transaction. If an auto-renew account is set, its key
 * must sign the transaction.
