/**
 * A transaction that allows a token owner to delegate a token spender to spend the specified token amount on behalf of
 * the token owner. An owner can provide a token allowance for HBARs, non-fungible and fungible tokens. The owner is the
 * account that owns the tokens and grants the allowance to the spender. The spender is the account that spends tokens
 * authorized by the owner from the owners account. The spender pays for the transaction fees when transferring tokens
 * from the owners account to another recipient.
 *
 * The total number of approvals in this transaction cannot exceed 20. Note that each NFT serial number counts as a
 * single approval, hence a transaction granting 20 serial numbers to a spender will use all of the approvals permitted
 * for the transaction.
 *
 * A single NFT serial number can only be granted to one spender at a time. If an approval assigns a previously approved
 * NFT serial number to a new user, the old user will have their approval removed.
 *
 * Each account is limited to 100 allowances. This limit spans HBAR and fungible token allowances and non-fungible token
 * approved_for_all grants. There is no limit on the number of NFT serial number approvals an owner may grant.
 *
 * The number of allowances set on an account will increase the auto-renewal fee for the account. Conversely, removing
 * allowances will decrease the auto-renewal fee for the account.
 *
 * To decrease the allowance for a given spender, you will need to set the amount to the value you would like to
 * authorize the spender account for. If the spender account was authorized to spend 25 HBARs and the owner now wants to
 * modify their allowance to 5 HBARs, the owner would submit the AccountAllowanceApproveTransaction for 5 HBARs.
 *
 * Only when a spender is set on an explicit NFT ID of a token, do we return the spender ID in TokenNftInfoQuery for the
 * respective NFT. If approveTokenNftAllowanceAllSerials is used to approve all NFTs for a given token class and no NFT
 * ID is specified, we will not return a spender ID for all the serial numbers of that token.
