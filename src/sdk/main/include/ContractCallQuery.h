 * A query that calls a function of the given smart contract instance, giving it function parameters as its inputs. This
 * is performed locally on the particular node that the client is communicating with. It cannot change the state of the
 * contract instance (and so, cannot spend anything from the instance's cryptocurrency account). It will not have a
 * consensus timestamp. It cannot generate a record or a receipt. The response will contain the output returned by the
 * function call. This is useful for calling getter functions, which purely read the state and don't change it. It is
 * faster and cheaper than a normal call because it is purely local to a single node.
 *
 * Unlike a contract execution transaction, the node will consume the entire amount of provided gas in determining the
 * fee for this query.
