/**
 * A transaction that generates a pseudorandom number. When the pseudorandom number generate transaction executes, its
 * transaction record will contain the 384-bit array of pseudorandom bytes. The transaction has an optional range
 * parameter. If the parameter is given and is positive, then the record will contain a 32-bit pseudorandom integer r,
 * where 0 <= r < range instead of containing the 384 pseudorandom bits.
 *
 * When the nth transaction needs a pseudorandom number, it is given the running hash of all records up to and including
 * the record for transaction n-3. If it needs 384 bits, then it uses the entire hash. If it needs 256 bits, it uses the
 * first 256 bits of the hash. If it needs a random number r that is in the range 0 <= r < range, then it lets x be the
 * first 32 bits of the hash (interpreted as a signed integer).
 *
 * The choice of using the hash up to transaction n-3 rather than n-1 is to ensure the transactions can be processed
 * quickly. Because the thread calculating the hash will have more time to complete it before it is needed. The use of
 * n-3 rather than n-1000000 is to make it hard to predict the pseudorandom number in advance.
