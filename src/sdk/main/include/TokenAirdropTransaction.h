/**
 * Airdrop one or more tokens to one or more accounts.
 *
 * ### Effects
 * This distributes tokens from the balance of one or more sending account(s) to the balance
 * of one or more recipient accounts. Accounts MAY receive the tokens in one of four ways.
 *
 *  - An account already associated to the token to be distributed SHALL receive the
 *    airdropped tokens immediately to the recipient account balance.
 *    The fee for this transfer SHALL include the transfer, the airdrop fee, and any custom fees.
 *  - An account with available automatic association slots SHALL be automatically
 *    associated to the token, and SHALL immediately receive the airdropped tokens to the
 *    recipient account balance.
 *    The fee for this transfer SHALL include the transfer, the association, the cost to renew
 *    that association once, the airdrop fee, and any custom fees.
 *  - An account with "receiver signature required" set SHALL have a "Pending Airdrop" created
 *    and must claim that airdrop with a `claimAirdrop` transaction.
 *    The fee for this transfer SHALL include the transfer, the association, the cost to renew
 *    that association once, the airdrop fee, and any custom fees. If the pending airdrop is not
 *    claimed immediately, the `sender` SHALL pay the cost to renew the token association, and
 *    the cost to maintain the pending airdrop, until the pending airdrop is claimed or cancelled.
 *  - An account with no available automatic association slots SHALL have a "Pending Airdrop"
 *    created and must claim that airdrop with a `claimAirdrop` transaction.
 *    The fee for this transfer SHALL include the transfer, the association, the cost to renew
 *    that association once, the airdrop fee, and any custom fees. If the pending airdrop is not
 *    claimed immediately, the `sender` SHALL pay the cost to renew the token association, and
 *    the cost to maintain the pending airdrop, until the pending airdrop is claimed or cancelled.
 *
 * If an airdrop would create a pending airdrop for a fungible/common token, and a pending airdrop
 * for the same sender, receiver, and token already exists, the existing pending airdrop
 * SHALL be updated to add the new amount to the existing airdrop, rather than creating a new
 * pending airdrop.
 *
 * Any airdrop that completes immediately SHALL be irreversible. Any airdrop that results in a
 * "Pending Airdrop" MAY be canceled via a `cancelAirdrop` transaction.
 *
 * All transfer fees (including custom fees and royalties), as well as the rent cost for the
 * first auto-renewal period for any automatic-association slot occupied by the airdropped
 * tokens, SHALL be charged to the account paying for this transaction.
 *
 * ### Record Stream Effects
 * - Each successful transfer SHALL be recorded in `token_transfer_list` for the transaction record.
 * - Each successful transfer that consumes an automatic association slot SHALL populate the
 *   `automatic_association` field for the record.
 * - Each pending transfer _created_ SHALL be added to the `pending_airdrops` field for the record.
 * - Each pending transfer _updated_ SHALL be added to the `pending_airdrops` field for the record.
