  /*
   * Hedera supports a form of auto account creation.
   *
   * You can "create" an account by generating a private key, and then deriving the public key, without any need to
   * interact with the Hedera network. The public key more or less acts as the user's account ID. This public key is an
   * account's mAliasKey: a public key that aliases (or will eventually alias) to a Hedera account.
   *
   * An AccountId takes one of two forms: a normal AccountId with a null mAliasKey member takes the form 0.0.123, while
   * an AccountId with a non-null mAliasKey member takes the form
   * 0.0.302a300506032b6570032100114e6abc371b82dab5c15ea149f02d34a012087b163516dd70f44acafabf7777.
   * Note the prefix of "0.0." indicating the shard and realm. Also note that the mAliasKey is stringified as a
   * hex-encoded ASN1 DER representation of the key.
   *
   * An AccountId with a mAliasKey can be used just like a normal AccountId for the purposes of queries and
   * transactions, however most queries and transactions involving such an AccountId won't work until Hbar has been
   * transferred to the mAliasKey account.
   *
   * There is no record in the Hedera network of an account associated with a given mAliasKey until an amount of Hbar is
   * transferred to the account. The moment that Hbar is transferred to that mAliasKey AccountId is the moment that that
   * account actually begins to exist in the Hedera ledger.
